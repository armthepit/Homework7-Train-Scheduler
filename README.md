# TrainScheduler

### Overview
Build a train schedule board app using Google Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate the data with Moment.js providing up to date information on each train with their departure time and remaining time left to board for departure in real time.

### Design Notes
	* All trains added need to be visible from any system.
	* Trains added need to include:
		* Train Name
		* Destination
		* First Departure
		* Frequency (Number of Minutes Between Trains)
	* Board needs to update in real time without any user intervention.

### Stack Used
	* CSS
	* HTML
	* Javascript
	* JQuery
	* Google Firebase Database
